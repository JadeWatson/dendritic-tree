# dendritic-tree-model
Designed and developped, in a group of 7, 3 types of neural networks to model the I/O relationship of a neuron using PyTorch. Explored the trade offs between computational evaluation and biological representation of a neuron using TCN, FCN, and CNNs. The TCN performed the best with a 30% accuracy increase to our supervising professors current McCulloch Pitts method. The team divided into 3 sub-teams: initial data translation and import, model development, and computational complexity evaluation. I was on the modelling team where I was responsible for designing model architecture and training of the models upon importing of the data.
